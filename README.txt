This is Readme file for SDF Project Even24 (A3 batch) 

Welcome to our game development project where we blend the nostalgia of classic arcade games with the power of modern C++ programming. 
In this venture, we'll be creating not just one, but two iconic games: Ping Pong and Snake. 
Both games have stood the test of time, captivating players for decades with their simple yet addictive gameplay mechanics.

About the Games:

Ping Pong: Originating in the early days of video gaming, Ping Pong (or Pong) is one of the earliest arcade games. Players control paddles to hit a ball back and forth, aiming to score points against their opponent. With its straightforward gameplay and competitive nature, Ping Pong has become a timeless classic.

Snake: Emerging in the late 1970s with the Nokia mobile phones, Snake game challenges players to control a growing snake as it navigates around obstacles and consumes food items. The game becomes increasingly challenging as the snake grows longer, testing players' reflexes and strategic thinking.

Project Goals:

Mastery of C++ Game Development 
Throughout this project, we'll delve into C++ game development, mastering concepts such as object-oriented programming, collision detection, and graphics rendering using libraries like SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library).

Gameplay Fusion and Innovation: By combining elements from Ping Pong and Snake, we explore how to merge gameplay mechanics.

Player Experience Enhancement: Our objective is to create games that are not only enjoyable to play but also provide a seamless and immersive experience for the player.

Tools and Technologies:
For this project, we have utilized:

C++ Programming Language: Leveraging the power of C++, we have write efficient code to implement game logic, mechanics, and user interactions.

SFML Library: SFMLserves as our toolkit for handling graphics, input events, allowing us to bring our games to life with ease.

Development Environment: W work within our preferred C++ development environment, whether it's Visual Studio, Code::Blocks.
